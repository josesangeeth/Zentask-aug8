**HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)** is the underlying protocol of the World Wide Web. Developed by Tim Berners-Lee and his team between 1989-1991

-> The initial version of HTTP had no version number; it has been later called 0.9 to differentiate it from the later versions. 
-> HTTP/0.9 is extremely simple: requests consist of a single line and start with the only possible method GET followed by the path to the resource (not the URL as both the protocol, server, and port are unnecessary once connected to the server).

-> The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol in the Internet protocol suite model for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information      systems.
-> HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access,    for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser. 

**Versions of HTTP**

-> HTTP/1 was first documented (as version 1.1) in 1997.

-> HTTP/2 is a more efficient expression of HTTP's semantics "on the wire", and was published in 2015, and is used by 45% of websites; it is now supported by virtually      all web browsers and major web servers over Transport Layer Security (TLS) using an Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) extension where TLS 1.2 or newer is    required.

-> HTTP/3 is the proposed successor to HTTP/2,and two-thirds of web browser users (both on desktop and mobile) can already use HTTP/3, on the 20% of websites that          already support it; it uses QUIC instead of TCP for the underlying transport protocol. 
   Like HTTP/2, it does not obsolete previous major versions of the protocol. 
   Support for HTTP/3 was added to Cloudflare and Google Chrome first,and is also enabled in Firefox.
